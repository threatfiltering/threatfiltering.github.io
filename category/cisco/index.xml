      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;cisco-zone-based-firewall-configuration-step-by-step-part-1&#34;&gt;Cisco Zone Based Firewall Configuration Step By Step: Part 1&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is the first part of Cisco Zone Based firewall configuration. It provides technology overview, configuration constructs and simple network configuration example. The part 2 will provide more complex examples with NAT, DMZ, VPNs and operation of self zone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cisco zone-based firewall (ZBF) is a feature of a Cisco router running IOS or IOS-XE. It is replacement for older CBAC (Context-Based Access Control) – “ip inspect” based configuration. Main difference is that ZBF uses zones with default “deny any” policy, and so called C3PL (Cisco Common Classification Policy Language) with class-maps and policy-maps constructs for classification and policy application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
